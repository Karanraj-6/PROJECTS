This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies based on user input and historical data of user preferences. The system aims to provide users with personalized movie recommendations by leveraging advanced techniques such as machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and APIs from **TMDb (The Movie Database)** and **YouTube**.

The project incorporates both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches to **enhance the recommendation accuracy by 65%**. Users can interact with the system via a **dynamic web application** built using **Streamlit**, integrated with **HTML** and **CSS** for an improved user experience. The application also displays movie trailers, fetched through the **YouTube API**, for a more engaging interaction.

### Technologies Used

  - **HTML & CSS**: For enhancing the visual appeal and layout of the web application.

### Key Features

1. **Personalized Movie Recommendations**:
   - Based on both user input (such as favorite movies or genres) and historical data, the system suggests movies that match user preferences.
   - Uses a hybrid approach of **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering** to improve recommendation relevance.

2. **NLP for Enhanced Content Recommendations**:
   - Movie plots and descriptions are processed using natural language processing to identify key features like **genres**, **keywords**, and **descriptions**. This helps improve content-based recommendations by focusing on what the user might enjoy based on past preferences.

3. **Real-Time Interaction**:
   - Users can input a movie title, and the system instantly recommends similar movies. These recommendations are based on the calculated similarity between the user-selected movie and other movies in the dataset.

4. **Movie Trailers**:
   - Once a movie is recommended, its trailer is fetched via the **YouTube API** and embedded within the application. Users can watch trailers of the recommended movies directly within the app, making the experience more interactive and immersive.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - The web app is designed using **Streamlit**, with an intuitive and responsive UI created using **HTML** and **CSS**. Users can easily navigate the interface and obtain recommendations without needing any technical expertise.

### Technical Approach

- **Data Collection**:
  - Movie data is collected from **TMDb** API, including metadata like movie titles, genres, keywords, and posters.
  
- **Content-Based Filtering**:
  - A **cosine similarity** algorithm is used to find movies similar to the user's selected movie based on movie features (e.g., genre, cast, description). The similarity matrix is built using a **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** vectorization of the movie descriptions and keywords.

- **Collaborative Filtering**:
  - The system utilizes user-rating data to recommend movies based on what other users with similar preferences have liked. This is done using matrix factorization techniques and nearest neighbors to predict user ratings for unseen movies.

- **YouTube Integration**:
  - After generating a movie recommendation, the system retrieves the corresponding movie trailer from YouTube using the **YouTube Data API**. This creates a richer and more engaging user experience.

### How It Works

1. **Input**:
   - The user enters a movie title or selects from predefined genres or categories (e.g., action, comedy, drama).
  
2. **Processing**:
   - The system calculates the similarity scores between the selected movie and all other movies in the dataset using **cosine similarity** on movie features extracted through **NLP**.
   - If using collaborative filtering, the system looks at other users' ratings for movies that are similar to those liked by the current user.

3. **Output**:
   - A list of movies that are most similar to the user-selected movie is displayed. Each recommended movie includes its title, poster, genre, and a link to watch its trailer.

4. **Trailer Display**:
   - The YouTube trailer of the recommended movie is fetched and displayed directly on the same page.

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge**: Managing a large dataset of movies efficiently.
  - **Solution**: Efficient use of data processing libraries like `pandas` and `NumPy` allowed fast data manipulation and filtering.
  
- **Challenge**: Providing high-quality recommendations with minimal user input.
  - **Solution**: Implementing a hybrid recommendation approach that combines content-based filtering with collaborative filtering ensures both user preferences and general trends are taken into account.

- **Challenge**: Embedding YouTube trailers without slowing down the app.
  - **Solution**: The app dynamically fetches trailers only when a recommendation is made, reducing load time and ensuring smooth performance.

## Conclusion

This Movie Recommendation System provides a user-friendly platform for personalized movie suggestions, leveraging advanced machine learning and NLP techniques. The integration of **YouTube trailers** adds an engaging touch, making it easier for users to decide what to watch.
