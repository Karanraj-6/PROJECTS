### Technical Approach

- **Data Collection**:
  - Movie data is collected from **TMDb** API, including metadata like movie titles, genres, keywords, and posters.
  
- **Content-Based Filtering**:
  - A **cosine similarity** algorithm is used to find movies similar to the user's selected movie based on movie features (e.g., genre, cast, description). The similarity matrix is built using a **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** vectorization of the movie descriptions and keywords.

- **Collaborative Filtering**:
  - The system utilizes user-rating data to recommend movies based on what other users with similar preferences have liked. This is done using matrix factorization techniques and nearest neighbors to predict user ratings for unseen movies.

- **YouTube Integration**:
  - After generating a movie recommendation, the system retrieves the corresponding movie trailer from YouTube using the **YouTube Data API**. This creates a richer and more engaging user experience.

### How It Works

1. **Input**:
   - The user enters a movie title or selects from predefined genres or categories (e.g., action, comedy, drama).
  
2. **Processing**:
   - The system calculates the similarity scores between the selected movie and all other movies in the dataset using **cosine similarity** on movie features extracted through **NLP**.
   - If using collaborative filtering, the system looks at other users' ratings for movies that are similar to those liked by the current user.

3. **Output**:
   - A list of movies that are most similar to the user-selected movie is displayed. Each recommended movie includes its title, poster, genre, and a link to watch its trailer.

4. **Trailer Display**:
   - The YouTube trailer of the recommended movie is fetched and displayed directly on the same page.

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge**: Managing a large dataset of movies efficiently.
